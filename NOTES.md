This dataset was originally digitized by Nathan W. Hill, and then later converted to its current presentation by Johann-Mattis List. The data themselves do not contain real "words", but rather collections of morphemes. Given that the author presents the morphemes for the same concept in a consistent order, we assume that the original order of these morphemes in the annotated words is well reflected. But it is possible that Mann, the original author of the dataset, did not include all morphemes in his analysis, and as a result, the lexemes should be used with some care.
